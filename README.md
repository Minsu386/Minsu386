### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 12 year Air Force veteran. In 2015, I was medically retired from active duty due to a diagnoses of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. While undergoing medical treatment, I saw how frustrated my medical team were with their use what technology is available.  I wanted to help alleviate this stress, so In 2016 I enrolled in my local community college and earned my AS Degree is Information Technology. For the next 2 years, I worked at my alumni as a Technical Support Specialist, learning the fundamentals of hardware and software troubleshooting. In 2023 I wanted to improve myself more and applied to the Fullstack Academy's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp, where I learned how to create CRUD applications utilizing the PostgresSQL, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS (PERN) stack. In this cohort my team and I created two amazing web applications. First we created an E-Commerse store called AnimeZon, which I later I forked and overhauled after graduating to the MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS (MERN) stack. I integrated Paypal for payment, and use pagination to limit the amount of products show to the user on screen. Second project we created an Electric Vehicle Charger Locator application using PERN, Google map API, and National Renewable Energy Laboratory API. This application gives the user the ability to search their local area for EV stations catered to their preferences, or to search an address. Both features allows the user to navigate to the selected charger location, thanks to Google's API.
