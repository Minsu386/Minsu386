### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 12-year Air Force veteran. In 2015, I was medically retired from active duty due to a diagnosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. While undergoing medical treatment, I saw how frustrated my medical team was with their use of what technology is available.  I wanted to help alleviate this stress, so In 2016 I enrolled in my local community college and earned my AS Degree in Information Technology. Afterward, I worked at my alumni as a Technical Support Specialist, learning the fundamentals of hardware and software troubleshooting. In 2023 I wanted to increase my knowledge of software and applied to the Fullstack Academy's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp, where I learned how to create CRUD applications utilizing the PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS (PERN) stack. In this cohort, my team and I created two amazing web applications. First, we created an E-commerce store called AnimeZon, which I later I forked and overhauled after graduating to the MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and NodeJS (MERN) stack. I integrated Paypal for payment and used pagination to limit the amount of products shown to the user on screen. Second project we created an Electric Vehicle Charger Locator application using PERN, Google map API, and National Renewable Energy Laboratory API. This application gives the user the ability to search their local area for EV stations catered to their preferences or to search for an address. Both features allow the user to navigate to the selected charger location, thanks to Google's API.
